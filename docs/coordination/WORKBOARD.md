# Work Board — Task Ownership Registry

**The single source of truth for "who is working on what."** Protocol in `docs/coordination/README.md`.

Rules: one owner per task · claim before you build (commit the claim first) · never edit a row you don't own · statuses `planned` → `in-progress` → `done` (never back).

- Owner = your unique agent name. `—` = unclaimed.
- `M1` (Foundation) is **DONE** and listed for reference only — do not reopen.
- Tasks are listed newest milestone first. Pick from `planned` in your milestone.

## M3 — Tenant + Provisioning (epic — next after M2)

> Goal: real multi-tenant ERP provisioning driven by the state machine (`apps/worker`), ERPNext client (`packages/erp`) wired through the API, isolation tests. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `DISCOVERY_REPORT.md`. Agent-to-agent thread: `docs/coordination/COMMS.md`.

## CRM — Deals & Engagement (epic — DONE)

> Goal: close the gap vs Frappe CRM. Baseline already shipped: Leads (stages, sources, value, probability, kanban, pipeline stats), Contacts, Customers. Reference patterns: reusable skill **`crm-ui-patterns`** (all-in-one record page, kanban, saved views, email templates, call UI) — load it before building. All work is demo-data-surface like the rest of M2 (no ERP dependency), so it is **not blocked** by the ERP cluster. Branch prefix `feat/crm/`. Full module (orgs, contacts, tasks, notes, activities, views, events, call-logs, email-templates, whatsapp, notifications, settings) shipped via PR #54.

| Task | Milestone | Owner | Status | Branch | Notes |

## M5 — Market-ready ERP (epic — data wiring + HRMS embed)

> Goal: make the platform market-ready by wiring every reference module to each tenant's **real ERPNext site** — the original "ERP gateway lands (M5)" plan — replacing in-memory demo data with live reads/writes, plus finishing the HRMS embed. Mandatory per module: `packages/erp` domain methods + tenant isolation tests + (where applicable) real-bench integration tests (TESTING.md §4). **Two parallel agent tracks own disjoint files so they never collide**: Track A owns `packages/erp/src/{sales,inventory}.ts` + sales/inventory API modules; Track B owns `packages/erp/src/{purchasing,finance}.ts` + purchasing/finance API modules. `mock-frappe-server.ts` is extended additively only. Contract shapes never change (frontend untouched except wiring).

| Task | Milestone | Owner | Status | Branch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M5-000 HRMS embed: hrms app install, amni_bridge SSO, /hrms UI | M5 | agent-platform | done | feat/M5/hrms-embed | PR #53 merged → dev; bench verified live: erpnext 16.30 + hrms + amni_bridge installed on site localhost, AMNI_SSO_SECRET set (matches apps/api HRMS_SSO_SECRET). Ops: db:migrate + install-hrms.ps1 + HRMS_SSO_SECRET. Follow-up: commit nested `amni_bridge` layout (flat-layout fix) + harden install-hrms.ps1 line 37. |
| **M5-001 ERP data wiring — Sales & Inventory (Track A foundation)** | M5 | agent-m5-erp-sales-inv | done | feat/M5/erp-sales-inv | `packages/erp/src/sales.ts` (Customer/Lead/Contact/Quotation/SalesOrder/SalesInvoice/Payment doctype methods + field maps) + `inventory.ts` (Item/Warehouse/StockMovement); submit/cancel via client; 14 unit + 7 isolation tests. ALSO fixed pre-existing mock-frappe-server bug: URL path segments now decoded (doctype names with spaces like "Sales Order" 404'd before). Fixed pre-existing hrms.service.ts lint (`import type ConfigService`). |
| M5-002 Sales & Inventory API wiring (replace seed → ERPNext reads/writes, same contract) | M5 | agent-m5-erp-sales-inv | done | feat/M5/erp-sales-inv | All 10 sales/inventory modules ERP-backed (customers, products, warehouses, stock movements, leads, deals, contacts, quotations, sales orders, sales invoices, record-payment) via `ErpGatewayService` (scopeFor/audit/translateErpError); additive `Opportunity` support in `packages/erp` for deals; in-scope `code` schemas relaxed to `min(1).max(80)` (code = ERPNext doc name); 6 new per-module isolation specs (+24 tests) → 476 api tests green; COMMS M5-COMMS-003 |
| **M5-003 Sales/Inventory dashboard KPIs + E2E sales journey** | M5 | agent-m5-erp-sales-inv | done | feat/M5/erp-sales-inv | revenue/AR/aging/low-stock KPIs from real ERP; Playwright signup→wizard→provision→customer→product→order→invoice→payment (apps/e2e) |
| **M5-004 ERP data wiring — Purchasing & Finance (Track B foundation)** | M5 | agent-m5-erp-purch-fin | done | feat/M5/erp-purch-fin | `packages/erp/src/purchasing.ts` (Supplier/PurchaseOrder/PurchaseInvoice) + `finance.ts` (ExpenseClaim/JournalEntry/Account/PaymentEntry); doctype field maps; unit + isolation tests. Implemented by agent-amni-01 (operator). PR #55 |
| M5-005 Purchasing & Finance API wiring (replace seed → ERPNext reads/writes, same contract) | M5 | agent-m5-erp-purch-fin | done | feat/M5/erp-purch-fin | suppliers, purchase orders, purchase invoices, expenses, payments wired through ErpGatewayService (code = ERPNext doc name, audit on mutations, status derived from docstatus/status, recordPayment = Payment Entry Pay/Supplier). Finance dashboard overview/report aggregated from Sales/Purchase Invoices + Payment Entries + Expense Claims. Isolation suites per module (mock-frappe-server is now doctype-aware + honors ?action=submit\|cancel). Implemented by agent-amni-01 (operator). PR #55 |
| M5-006 Finance dashboard KPIs + E2E finance journey | M5 | agent-m5-erp-purch-fin | done | feat/M5/erp-purch-fin | AP/cash/expense/reporting KPIs from real ERP (revenue/AR from submitted Sales Invoices, AP from Purchase Invoices, cash from net Payment Entries, expenses from Expense Claims; aging buckets by due date; statement reports computed from the same doctypes). E2E finance journey not run (deployment paused). Implemented by agent-amni-01 (operator). PR #55 |
| M5-007 Real-bench integration test tier + CI gates | M5 | agent-m5-erp-purch-fin | done | feat/M5/erp-purch-fin | CI runs `pnpm test:isolation` on every PR + merge-to-dev gate; TESTING.md §4/§8 updated (in-repo isolation harness documented as always-on). Real frappe_docker supertest tier remains parked until the bench is reachable (deployment paused). Also fixed pre-existing worker lint (`import type` in imports.processor.spec). Implemented by agent-amni-01 (operator). PR #55 |

## M7 — Demo seed + tenant provisioning (dev)

> Goal: make the demo accounts actually work post-M5. Root cause of the dashboard 409s (`TENANT_NOT_READY`): the old `seed-demo-user.ts` put **both** demo users in one "Demo Co" and created **no** `Tenant`/`ERPInstance`, so every ERP-backed read (`/api/v1/dashboard/*`) 409'd. Fix: seed a **pure SaaS platform admin** (no company membership, lands on `/admin` console) plus **one normal company** with its own isolated ERPNext instance and two accounts inside it (company admin/OWNER + employee/MEMBER). Two disjoint agents; files never overlap.

| Task | Milestone | Owner | Status | Branch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **M7-001 SaaS admin demo → SaaS console (A)** | M7 | agent-amni-01 | done | feat/M7/saas-admin-demo | New `apps/api/scripts/seed-saas-admin.ts`: upsert `owner@amni.com` (`isPlatformAdmin: true`, **no** membership, ACTIVE/verified). Post-login redirect for platform admins → `/admin` in `apps/web/app/login/{login-form,quick-login}.tsx` + quick-login label (SaaS Admin / Company Admin / Company Member). Verified live: login 201, `/auth/me` `isPlatformAdmin: true`, `/api/v1/admin/{summary,tenants}` 200, memberships=0. **Merged to dev as `ab2af60` (PR #63)**. Remaining cross-check (needs M7-002): `/admin` tenants table lists Demo Co. |
| **M7-002 Company demo seed (admin + member) → company dashboard (B)** | M7 | agent-amni-01 (operator; reassigned from agent-m7-company-demo) | done | feat/M7/company-demo-seed | New `apps/api/scripts/seed-demo-company.ts`: one company **Demo Co** (`demo-co`) with two memberships — `admin@demo.amni`/`admin12345` OWNER + `member@demo.amni`/`member12345` MEMBER — plus ACTIVE `Tenant` + `ERPInstance` (host `http://localhost:8080`, HEALTHY, `serviceKeyCipher` via running `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, overridable `DEMO_ERP_API_KEY`/`DEMO_ERP_API_SECRET`) + TRIAL `Subscription`. Also fixed pre-existing `Tenant.hrmsInstalled` schema drift (`@map("hrms_installed")`) and the M5 `reorder_level`→`safety_stock` Item-field bug (real bench 417; mock never validates fields). **Verified live on the frappe_docker bench** (site `frontend`, ERPNext 16.30): login 201 for both accounts, `/api/v1/dashboard/{overview,activity,alerts}` → 200 (admin 4 KPIs; member `?role=member` revenue-only). **PR #1 on `feat/M7/company-demo-seed`** (commits `d129c42`, `f39046e`, `d456db5`, `fc90c50`). COMMS M7-COMMS-002. |

## M6 — Onboarding gaps + Platform Admin console (SaaS)

> Goal: close the onboarding gaps surfaced in the userflow review — (1) signup copy promised background provisioning that never happened, (2) the setup wizard was unreachable except via ⌘K, (3) no server-side route guard — and ship the missing **platform admin dashboard** so the operator sees every tenant with its status, plan, subscription, provisioning job trail, members and ERP instance. Decision (operator, 2026-08-15): provisioning stays at wizard submit (honest copy + route new signups through the wizard), matching PRODUCT_SPEC + SECURITY.md email-verify-before-provision.

| Task | Milestone | Owner | Status | Branch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M6-001 Server-side route guard (Next.js middleware; no session cookie → `/login`) + login `next` param | M6 | agent-amni-01 | done | fix/onboarding-gaps | `apps/web/middleware.ts`; one-directional (no cookie→skip-login redirect) to avoid httpOnly-cookie redirect loops. PR #61 |
| M6-002 Onboarding flow fix (honest signup copy + new signups land on `/setup` wizard; e2e updated) | M6 | agent-amni-01 | done | fix/onboarding-gaps | provisioning stays at wizard submit (SECURITY.md email-verify gate). PR #61 |
| M6-003 Platform admin identity: `User.isPlatformAdmin` + migration + seed flags | M6 | agent-amni-01 | done | feat/admin-dashboard | `demo@amni.dev` + `admin@amni.dev` flagged platform admins. PR #62 |
| M6-004 Admin API (`/admin/summary`, `/admin/tenants`, `/admin/tenants/:id`) + AdminGuard + shared schemas | M6 | agent-amni-01 | done | feat/admin-dashboard | 403 for non-admins; 5 unit tests. PR #62 |
| M6-005 Admin console web UI (`/admin` shell, summary cards, tenants table, tenant detail w/ provisioning timeline) | M6 | agent-amni-01 | done | feat/admin-dashboard | `/auth/me` returns `isPlatformAdmin`; user-menu entry. PR #62 |

## Change log of the board itself

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-16 | **M7-002 implemented + verified live** (agent-amni-01, PR #1 on `feat/M7/company-demo-seed`): `seed-demo-company.ts` seeds Demo Co (`demo-co`) with admin/member accounts + ACTIVE Tenant + ERPInstance (real bench creds ciphered) + TRIAL sub. Live-verified on frappe_docker bench (site `frontend`): dashboard overview/activity/alerts 200 for both accounts; member `?role=member` = revenue-only KPI. Also fixed pre-existing `Tenant.hrmsInstalled` schema drift (`@map`) and the M5 Item `reorder_level`→`safety_stock` bug (mock never validated fields; real bench 417'd). Provisioning gap flagged (bench service account has no api_key/roles) — COMMS M7-COMMS-002. |
| 2026-08-16 | **M7-001 merged to dev** — PR #63 squash as `ab2af60` (agent-amni-01): seed-saas-admin.ts + platform-admin → `/admin` redirect + quick-login demo accounts. M7-002 (company seed) in-progress (reassigned to operator lane). |
| 2026-08-16 | **M7-001 implemented** (agent-amni-01, PR #63 on `feat/M7/saas-admin-demo`): `seed-saas-admin.ts` (`owner@amni.com`, platform admin, no membership) + platform-admin post-login redirect → `/admin` in login-form + quick-login (demo accounts updated: SaaS Admin `owner@amni.com`, Company Admin `admin@demo.amni`, Company Member `member@demo.amni`). Live-verified login/auth-me/admin API 200. M7-002 (company seed) in-progress (reassigned to operator lane). |
| 2026-08-16 | M7-002 reassigned by operator from agent-m7-company-demo → agent-amni-01 (operator lane) on `feat/M7/company-demo-seed`; implementation started (seed script + env key wiring). COMMS M7-COMMS-001. |
| 2026-08-16 | **M7 registered + claimed**: demo seed + tenant provisioning. Root cause of dashboard 409s = old `seed-demo-user.ts` put both demo users in one "Demo Co" with no Tenant/ERPInstance. M7-001 (agent-amni-01, `feat/M7/saas-admin-demo`): `owner@amni.com` pure SaaS platform admin (no membership) → lands on `/admin` console. M7-002 (agent-m7-company-demo, `feat/M7/company-demo-seed`): one company Demo Co with `admin@demo.amni` OWNER + `member@demo.amni` MEMBER + own isolated Tenant/ERPInstance/subscription → both land on `/dashboard`. Claims committed; implementation not started. |
| 2026-08-15 | M6 registered + claimed (agent-amni-01): onboarding gaps (route guard, signup→wizard flow) on `fix/onboarding-gaps`; platform admin console (identity, API, web UI) on `feat/admin-dashboard`. Decision: provisioning stays at wizard submit. |
| 2026-08-15 | **EPIC M6 complete** — PR #61 merged (onboarding gaps: route guard + signup→wizard flow); admin console (identity + API + web UI) merged via PR #62 (squash) — M6-003/004/005 done. `/admin` console is platform-admin-only (AdminGuard 403 for non-admins; client-side access-denied state). Note for future agents: pre-existing schema drift (`hrms_installed` in the M5-000 migration vs `hrmsInstalled` in `schema.prisma`) left untouched — see COMMS M6-COMMS-001. |
| 2026-08-15 | PR #46 merged to dev (68babf5, squash): landing page redesign — sticky blur header, framer-motion hero (`landing-hero.tsx`), feature cards (`landing-features.tsx`), footer. Branch `feat/landing-redesign` synced onto latest dev before merge (conflict resolved in `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, dev's hero tweaks superseded by the new `LandingHero`). |
| 2026-08-15 | PR #47 merged to dev (80f21d0, squash): web API clients default to same-origin `/api/v1` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is unset (preview-tunnel fix). Follow-up noted: `deals.ts` + `imports.ts` still carry the old localhost default (added to dev after #47 branched). |
| 2026-08-15 | **EPIC M5 complete** — PR #55 merged to dev (c923a33, squash): M5-004..M5-007 (Track B) landed — purchasing/finance ERP wiring + finance dashboard KPIs + isolation CI gate. Combined with Track A (PR #56), the M5 market-readiness epic is now done. Pre-merge sync fixed the Track A↔B PaymentEntry symbol collision (Track A renamed to `Sales*`, Track B canonical) and rebuilt COMMS/WORKBOARD docs. COMMS M5-COMMS-006/007. |
| 2026-08-14 | CI unblock (agent-m5-erp-sales-inv): removed broken `cache: pnpm` post-step from all 4 CI jobs — it failed every job repo-wide (`Path Validation Error` in actions/setup-node) while all real steps passed; added `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist for e2e test-only mock fixtures; fixed pre-existing worker spec `typeof import()` lint + root `nanoid@^3.3.18` audit override. COMMS M5-COMMS-005. |
| 2026-08-14 | M5-000 marked done (agent-platform): PR #53 merged to dev (b8d849e) — HRMS embed live. M5-003 marked done (agent-m5-erp-sales-inv): ERP-backed dashboard KPIs + e2e suite landed on feat/M5/erp-sales-inv (PR #56); AP KPI remains deferred to Track B (M5-005). COMMS M5-COMMS-004. |
| 2026-08-14 | M5-003 (agent-m5-erp-sales-inv): Playwright E2E suite added under apps/e2e (@amni/e2e) covering the critical journey signup→wizard→provision + seeded-owner customer→product→order→invoice→payment→dashboard KPIs; global-setup seeds a fresh tenant against an in-process mock Frappe server and skips gracefully when Postgres/Redis are down; onboarding spec requires Redis.
